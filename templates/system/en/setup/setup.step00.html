      The LoxBerry extends your Loxone Smarthome by many interesting and useful features, which are not provided by Loxone itself. These features
      are realized using plugins, which can be installed later on.

      <p>
      The LoxBerry system is free of charge and is maintained by volunteers in their leisure time. The source code is free and is distributed
      under the Apache 2.0-License. LoxBerry was born as an idea discussed in the <a href="https://www.loxforum.com/" target="_blank">Loxone Forum</a>.

      In the following setup wizard the basic system settings like networking or time server are done.
      The LoxBerry will not work without these mandatory settings. All further plugins (features) can be installed and configured later on.
